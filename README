notes:
In process_reload_config you have the following options:
- terminate current amqp connection and start a new one.
  Working children would then crash on amqp operations
- just open a new connection. It can lead to connections leak in case of
  too often reconfiguration.
- NOT DONE: open new conn/chann and send it to every child
